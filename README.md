## Austians
This project is basically a social networking app designed for the students of Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology or shortly known as AUST. Hence the name Aust_ians. This is an android application compiled with the language Java on the compiler Android Studio.
The students of AUST usually communicate with each other via Facebook groups where various posts regarding different matters are being posted everyday.
